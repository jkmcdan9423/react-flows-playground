# Vacation Prediction
This is a playground for testing react-flows library and having fun! Simply drag the vacation options from the sidebar into the field and connect your nodes. The randomizer will pick from one of your node options to select your next vacation destination.

Written with React and TypeScript, built by Vite.

To run, `npm i` and `npm run dev`

This is not a complete project and there are many things that could be optimized and organized. This was simply a fun little project exploring react-flow and testing things out. Much inspiration taken from react-flow docs!
